/// A binary heap is a heap data structure created using a binary tree.
/// It can be seen as a binary tree with two additional constraints:
///
/// **Shape property:**
///     A binary heap is a complete binary tree; that is, all levels of the tree,
///     except possibly the last one (deepest) are fully filled, and, if the last level
///     of the tree is not complete, the nodes of that level are filled from left to right.
///
/// **Heap property:**
///     All nodes are either greater than or equal to or less than or equal to each of its children,
///     according to a comparison predicate defined for the heap.
///
/// **See also:**
///     [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap)

    /// Initialize an empty heap
    init()

    // TODO: how do we want to handle this?
    // ultimately we'd like to have both versions i.e. init with comparable element
    // or with comparison func
    //
    // Problem right now is that we cannot really easily specialize types that way
    // We can support init() with extension below based on init(isOrderedBefore:)
    // but that is *much* slower than having an implementation that relies on Comparable
    // 
    // In Comparable case compiler specializes generic type & potentially inlines comparison
    // check
    // Whereas in other case we always need to store a closure & run that which needs a bit of
    // extra memory and contents aren't really inlined so we have to pay function call overhead
    // init(isOrderedBefore: (Element, Element) -> Bool)

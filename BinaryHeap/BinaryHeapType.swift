/// A binary heap is a heap data structure created using a binary tree.
/// It can be seen as a binary tree with two additional constraints:
///
/// **Shape property:**
///     A binary heap is a complete binary tree; that is, all levels of the tree,
///     except possibly the last one (deepest) are fully filled, and, if the last level
///     of the tree is not complete, the nodes of that level are filled from left to right.
///
/// **Heap property:**
///     All nodes are either greater than or equal to or less than or equal to each of its children,
///     according to a comparison predicate defined for the heap.
///
/// **See also:**
///     [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap)

// TODO: migrate & cleanup more stuff
// TODO: can we extract some more common stuff?

// TODO: tests...

// TODO: Additional variants
//      * Swift implementation of CFHeap
//      * ComboHeap(s) (might also try to make impl that uses separate subtypes for ref/val types)
//      * Heap that like CF uses UnsafePtr throughout but uses only internally
//          * -> Allocates ptrs for elements itself, moves there
//          * -> maybe best to allocate buffer together with buffer for heap (same size)
//          * -> in AnyObj case ideally just uses unsafeAddressOf with retain/release

// TODO: Also collect all tests when used with code in framework...
// TODO: experiment with @transparent, etc... effect on framework (maybe put this in Swift?)

// TODO: Collect results & sort by speed (where applicable)
// TODO: there's is quite a bit of variance in the results (prob due to randomized elements
//          -> perf obviously depends on elements & order)
//          -> run multiple iterations


// TODO: Variants (where possible) that use comparison closure instead of Comparable
//      Do we need to duplicate all or can we share some stuff?
